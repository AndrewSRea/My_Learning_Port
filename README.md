# My_Learning_Port

Hello. This is my learning development repository. This will show my step-by-step development through various coding languages
and techniques which will be necessary for me to retain my knowledge of web development skills.

## About Me

I have achieved a Certificate of Completion from the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp. In the UofO Bootcamp, we studied all 
of the necessary coding languages and techniques necessary to become a Full-Stack Web Developer, which are the following:

* Git
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* React.js

## The Purpose of This Repository

Although I did complete and graduate from the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp, I must confess it was a bit difficult to
retain all of the knowledge which was afforded to me through the UofO program as each language and technique listed above was 
only presented on a week-to-week basis, i.e. our class learned the HTML5 language during one week, and then CSS3 was taught
on the very next week, and then our class moved on to JavaScript the very next week. Needless to say, it was not easy to retain
the knowledge of each language or technique in just one week. But somehow, I retained just enough knowledge week-by-week in order
to pass the Bootcamp!

So I have created this repository to allow myself to review all of the coding languages and techniques I learned in the University
of Oregon Coding Bootcamp. I will be using different online reference websites, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a>, to guide me along the way to refresh my knowledge. Within this repository, I will have several folders specifically created for each language or technique, such as the Bootstrap folder which I intend to create first.

I have already refreshed my knowledge on HTML5 and CSS3 by reviewing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla</a> web developer resource. So join me in my [folder on Bootstrap](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap) as I start my journey on relearning web development!
