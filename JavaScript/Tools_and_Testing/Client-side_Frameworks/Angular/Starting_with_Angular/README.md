# Getting started with Angular

It is now time to look at Google's Angular framework, another popular option that you'll come across often. In this article, we look at what Angular has to offer, install the prerequisites and set up a sample app, and look at Angular's basic architecture.

## What is Angular?

Angular is a development platform, built on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). As a platform, Angular includes:

* A component-based framework for building scalable web applications.
* A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more.
* A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code.

When you build applications with Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as easy as possible, so you can take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.

Before you start exploring the Angular platform, you should know about the Angular CLI. The Angular CLI is the fastest, easiest, and recommended way to develop Angular applications. The Angular CLI makes a number of tasks easy. Here are some examples:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| [`ng build`](https://angular.io/cli/build) | Compiles an Angular app into an output directory. |
| [`ng serve`](https://angular.io/cli/serve) | Builds and serves your application, rebuilding on file changes. |
| [`ng generate`](https://angular.io/cli/generate) | Generates or modifies files based on a schematic. |
| [`ng test`](https://angular.io/cli/test) | Runs unit tests on a given project. |
| [`ng e2e`](https://angular.io/cli/e2e) | Builds and serves an Angular application, then runs end-to-end tests. |

You'll find the Angular CLI to be a valuable tool for building out your applications.
