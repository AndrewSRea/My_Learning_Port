# Working with Svelte stores

In the last article, we completed the development of our app, finished organizing it into components, and discussed some advanced techniques for dealing with reactivity, working with DOM nodes, and exposing component functionality. In this article, we will show another way to handle state management in Svelte -- [Stores](). Stores are global data repositories that hold values. Components can subscribe to stores and receive notifications when their values change.
