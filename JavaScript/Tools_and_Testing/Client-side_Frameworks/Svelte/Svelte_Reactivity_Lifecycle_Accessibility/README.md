# Advanced Svelte: Reactivity, lifecycle, accessibility

In the last article, we added more features to our To-Do list and started to organize our app into components. In this article, we will add the app's final features and further componentize our app. We will learn how to deal with reactivity issues related to updating objects and arrays. To avoid common pitfalls, we'll have to dig a little deeper into Svelte's reactivity system. We'll also look at solving some accessibility focus issues, and more besides.
