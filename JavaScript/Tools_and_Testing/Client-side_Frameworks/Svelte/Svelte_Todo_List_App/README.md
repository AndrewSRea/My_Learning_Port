# Starting our Svelte Todo List app

Now that we have a basic understanding of how things work in Svelte, we can start building our example app: a todo list. In this article, we will first have a look at the desired functionality or our app, then we'll create a `Todos.svelte` component and put static markup and styles in place, leaving everything ready to start developing our To-Do list app features, which we'll go on to in subsequent articles.

We want our users to be able to browse, add, and delete tasks, and also to mark them as complete. This will be the basic functionality that we'll be developing in this tutorial series, plus we'll look at some more advanced concepts along the way, too.
