# Introduction to client-side frameworks

We begin our look at frameworks with a general overview of the area, looking at a brief history of JavaScript and frameworks, why frameworks exist and what they give us, how to start thinking about choosing a framework to learn, and what alternatives there are to client-side frameworks.

## A brief history

When JavaScript debuted in 1996, it added occassional interactivity and excitement to a web that was, up until then, composed of satic documents. The web became not just a place to *read things*, but to *do things*. JavaScript's popularity steadily increased. Developers who worked with JavaScript wrote tools to solve the prolems they faced, and packaged them into reusable packages called **libraries**, so they could share their solutions with others. This shared ecosystem of libraries helped shape the growth of the web.

Now, JavaScript is an essential part of the web, [used on 95% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript), and the web is an essential part of modern life. Users write papers, manage their budgets, stream music, watch movies, and communicate with others over great distances instantaneously, with text, audio or video chat. The web allows us to do things that used to be possible only in native applications installed on our computers. These modern, complex, interactive websites are often referred to as **web applications**.

The advent of modern JavaScript frameworks has made it much easier to build highly dynamic, interactive applications. A **framework** is a library that offers opinions about how software gets built. These opinions allow for predictability and homogeneity in an application; predictability allows software to scale to an enormous size and still be maintainable; predictability and maintainability are essential for the health and longevity of software.

JavaScript frameworks power much of the impressive software on the modern web -- including many of the websites you likely use every day. MDN Web Docs, which you are currently reading this on, uses the React/ReactDOM framework to power its front end.
