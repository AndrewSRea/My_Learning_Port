# Pull Requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

## About pull requests

<hr>

**Note**: When working with pull requests, keep the following in mind:

* If you're working in the [shared repository model](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models), we recommend that you use a topic branch for your pull request. While you can send pull requests from any branch or commit, with a topic branch you can push follow-up commits if you need to update your proposed changes.
* When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push. Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.

You can create pull requests on GitHub.com, with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), in [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), on [GitHub for mobile](https://github.com/mobile), and when using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes
