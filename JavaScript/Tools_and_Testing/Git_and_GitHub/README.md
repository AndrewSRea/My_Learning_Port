# Git and GitHub

All developers will use some kind of **version control system (VCS)**, a tool to allow them to collaborate with other developers on a project without the danger of them overwriting each other's work, and roll back to previous versions of the code base if a problem is discovered later on. The most popular VCS (at least, among web developers) is **Git**, along with **GitHub**, a site that provides hosting for your repositories and several tools for working with them. This module aims to teach you what you need to know about both of them.
