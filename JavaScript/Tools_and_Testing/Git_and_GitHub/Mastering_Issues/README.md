# Mastering issues

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They're kind of like email -- except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub's tracker is called **issues**, and has its own section in every repository.

For example, let's take a look at [Bootstrap's Issues section](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues):

GitHub's issue tracking is special because of our focus on collaboration, references, and excellent text formatting. A typical issue on GitHub looks a bit like this:

![Image of a single issue in a GitHub repo](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/example-issue.png)

* A **title** and **description** describe what the issue is all about.
* Color-coded **labels** help you categorize and filter your issues (just like labels in email).
* A **milestone** acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases (e.g. *Weekly Sprint 9/5-9/16* or *Shipping 1.0*).
* One **assignee** is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
* **Comments** allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.

## Milestones, Labels, and Assignees

Once you've collected a lot of issues, you may find it hard to find the ones you care about. **Milestones**, **labels**, and **assignees** are great features to filter and categorize issues.

You can change or add a milestone, an assignee, and labels by clicking their corresponding gear icons in the sidebar on the right.

If you don't see edit buttons, that's because you don't have permission to edit the issue. You can ask the repository owner to add you as a collaborator to get access.

### Milestones

Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period. People use them in many different ways in software development. Some examples of milestones on GitHub include:

* **Beta Launch** - File bugs that you need to fix before you can launch the beta of your project. It's a great way to make sure you aren't missing anything.
* **October Sprint** - File issues that you'd like to work on in October. A great way to focus your efforts when there's a lot to do.
* **Redesign** - File issues related to redesigning your project. A great way to collect ideas on what to work on.

### Labels

Labels are a great way to organize different types of issues. Issues can have as many labels as you want, and you can filter by one or many labels at once.

### Assignees

Each issue can have an assignee -- one person that's responsible for moving the issue forward. Assignees are selected the same way milestones are, through the grey bar at the top of the issue.

## Notifications, @mentions, and References

By using @mentions and references inside of Issues, you can notify other GitHub users & teams, and cross-connect issues to each other. These provide a flexible way to get the right people involved to resolve issues effectively, and are easy to learn and use. They work across all text fields on GitHub -- they're a part of our text formatting syntax called [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github#name-and-team-mentions-autocomplete).

### Notifications

[Notifications](https://github.com/notifications) are GitHub's way to keep up to date with your issues. You can use them to find out about new issues on repositories, or just to know when someone needs your input to move forward on an issue.

There are two ways to receive notifications: via email, and via the web. You can configure how you receive notifications [in your settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications). If you plan on receiving a lot of notifications, we like to recommend that you receive web + email notifications for **Participating** and web notifications for **Watching**.

![Image of the settings for GitHub notifications](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/notifications.png)

With these settings, you receive emails when people specifically mention you, then visit the web-based interface to keep up to date with repositories you're interested in.

You can access your notifications through the [notifications](https://github.com/notifications) screen. This screen is nice for screening many notifications at once and marking them as read or muting the thread. Try using keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow here -- press <kbd>?</kbd> on the page to see which shortcuts are available.

Muted threads won't show up as unread again until you are specifically @mentioned again. This makes muting a great strategy for threads
