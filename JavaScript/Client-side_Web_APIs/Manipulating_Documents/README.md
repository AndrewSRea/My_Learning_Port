# Manipulating documents

When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want to do is manipulate the document structure in some way. This is usually done by using the Document Object Model (DOM), a set of APIs for controlling HTML and styling information that makes heavy use of the [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) object. In this article, we'll look at how to use the DOM in detail, along with some other interesting APIs that can alter your environment in interesting ways.

## The important parts of a web browser

Web browsers are very complicated pieces of software with a lot of moving parts, many of which can't be controlled or manipulated by a web developer using JavaScript. You might think that such limitations are a bad thing, but browsers are locked down for good reasons, mostly centering around security. Imagine if a web site could get access to your stored passwords or sensitive information, and log into websites as if it were you?

Despite the limitations, Web APIs still give us access to a lot of functionality that enable us to do a great many things with web pages. There are a few really obvious bits you'll reference regularly in your code--consider the following diagram, which represents the main parts of a browser directly involved in viewing web pages:

* The window is the browser tab that a web page is loaded into; this is represented in JavaScript by the [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) object. Using methods available on this object, you can do things like return the window's size (see [`Window.innerWidth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerWidth) and [`Window.innerHeight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight)), manipulate the document loaded into that window, store data specific to that document on the client-side (for example, using a local database or other stoarge mechanism), attach an [event handler](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/JavaScript/JS_Building_Blocks/Intro_to_Events#a-series-of-fortunate-events) to the current window, and more.
* The navigator represents the state and identity of the browser (i.e. the user-agent) as it exists on the web. In JavaScript, this is represented by the [`Navigator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) object. You can use this object to retrieve things like the user's preferred language, a media stream from the user's webcam, etc.
* The document (represented by the DOM in browsers) is the actual page loaded into the window, and is represented in JavaScript by the [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) object. You can use this object to return and manipulate information on the HTML and CSS that comprises the document. For example, get a reference to an element in the DOM, change its text content, apply new styles to it, create elements and add them to the current element as children, or even delete it altogether.

In this article, we'll focus mainly on manipulating the document, but we'll show a few other useful bits besides.
