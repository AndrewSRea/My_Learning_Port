# JavaScript

## Dynamic client-side scripting

JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at--displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, or more--you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.
