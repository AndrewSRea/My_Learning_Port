# Basic math in JavaScript -- numbers and operators

At this point in the course, we discuss math in JavaScript--how we can use [operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Operator) and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.

## Everybody loves math

Okay, maybe not. Some of us like math, some of us have hated math ever since we had to learn multiplication tables and long division in school, and some of us sit somewhere in between the two. But none of us can deny that math is a fundamental part of life that we can't get very far without. This is especially true when we are learning to program JavaScript (or any other language, for that matter)--so much of what we do relies on processing numerical data, calculating new values, and so on, that you won't be surprised to learn that JavaScript has a full-featured set of math functions available.
