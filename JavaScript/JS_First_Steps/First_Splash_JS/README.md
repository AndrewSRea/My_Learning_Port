# A first splash into JavaScript

Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript and what you can do with it, we are going to give you an idea of what the process of creating a simple JavaScript program is like, by guiding you through a practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number" game, step by step.

We want to set really clear expectations here: You won't be expected to learn JavaScript by the end of this article, or even understand all the code we are asking you to write. Instead, we want to give you an idea of how JavaScript's features work together, and what writing JavaScript feels like. In subsequent articles, you'll revisit all the features shown here in a lot more detail, so don't worry if you don't understand it all immediately!

**Note**: Many of the code features you'll see in JavaScript are the same as in other programming languages--functions, loops, etc. The code syntax looks different, but the concepts are still largely the same.

## Thinking like a programmer

One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer--this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.

This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the progamming syntax, and practice--plus, a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it. We can't promise that you'll develop "programmer brain" in five minutes, but we will give you plenty of opportunity to practice thinking like a programmer throughout the course.

With that in mind, let's look at the example we'll be building up in this article, and review the general process of dissecting it into tangible tasks.

## Example - Guess the number game

In this article, we'll show you how to build up the simple game you can see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash#example_%E2%80%94_guess_the_number_game). <!-- swap with your own version (GitHub pages) -->

Have a go at playing it--familiarize yourself with the game before you move on.

Let's imaging your boss has given you the following brief for creating this game:
