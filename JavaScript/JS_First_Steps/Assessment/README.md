# Silly story generator

In this assessment, you'll be tasked with taking some of the knowledge you've picked up in this module's articles and applying it to creating a fun app that generates random silly stories. Have fun!

## Starting point

To get this assessment started, you should:

This also has the CSS to style the example contained within it.
