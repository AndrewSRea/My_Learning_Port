# Test your skills: Functions

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood Mozilla's [Function -- reusable blocks of code](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/JavaScript/JS_Building_Blocks/Functions#functions----reusable-blocks-of-code), [Build your own function](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/JavaScript/JS_Building_Blocks/Build_Your_Function#build-your-own-function), and [Function return values](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/JavaScript/JS_Building_Blocks/Function_Return_Values#function-return-values) articles.

## DOM manipulation: considered useful

Some of the questions below require you to write some [DOM]() manipulation code to complete them--such as creating new HTML elements, setting their text contents to equal specific string values, and nesting them inside existing elements on the page--all via JavaScript.

We haven't explicitly taught this yet in the course, but you'll have seen some examples that make use of it, and we'd like you to do some research into what DOM APIs you need to successfully answer the questions. A good starting place is Mozilla's [Manipulating documents]() tutorial. <!-- future folder "Client-side_Web_APIs / Manipulating_Documents" -->
