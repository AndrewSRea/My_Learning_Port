        /* So, to be truthful: It took me quite a while to figure out the correct `if...else` structure for the `machineActive`
           indicator (`true` on top? `false` on top?), then configuring the correct nested `else if` structure. But I finally
           figured that structure out.
           BUT...I had some real difficulty trying to figure out how to configure the `score` ranges; specifically, which ranges
           required `less than` operators and `greater than` operators. I knew the `less than 0` and `greater than 100` range
           just needed `score < 0 || score > 100` but the other ranges were difficult to configure, and my code was not working
           --so I had to look at the solution for those ranges.
