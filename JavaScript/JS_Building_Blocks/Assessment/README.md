# Image gallery

Now that we've looked at the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, we'll test your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals, and events by getting you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites--a JavaScript-powered image gallery.

## Starting point

To get this assessment started, you should go and [grab the ZIP]() file for the example, unzip it somewhere on your computer, and do the exercise locally to begin with.

Alternatively, you could use a site like [JSBin]() or [Glitch]() to do your assessment. You could paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one of these online editors. If the online editor you are using doesn't have separate JavaScript/CSS panels, feel free to put them inline `<script>`/`<style>` elements inside the HTML page.
