# Date formatting using luxon

The default rendering of dates from our models is very ugly: *Tue Oct 06 2020 15:49:58 GMT+1100 (AUS Eastern Daylight Time)*. In this section, we'll show how you can update the *BookInstance List* page from the previous section to present the `due_date` field in a more friendly format: Oct 6th, 2020.
