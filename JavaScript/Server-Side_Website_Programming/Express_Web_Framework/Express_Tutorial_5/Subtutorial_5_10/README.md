# Book detail page

The *Book detail page* needs to display the information for a specific `Book` (identified using its automatically generated `_id` field value), along with information about each associated copy in the library (`BookInstance`). Wherever we display an author, genre, or book instance, these should be linked to the associated detail page for that item.
