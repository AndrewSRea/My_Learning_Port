# BookInstance detail page and challenge

## BookInstance detail page

The `BookInstance` detail page needs to display the information for each `BookInstance`, identified using its (automatically generated) `_id` field value. This will include the `Book` name (as a link to the *Book detail page*) along with other information in the record.
