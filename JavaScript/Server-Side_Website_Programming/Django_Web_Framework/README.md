# Django Web Framework (Python)

Django is an extremely popular and fully featured server-side web framework, written in Python. This module shows you why Django is one of the most popular web server frameworks, how to set up a development environment, and how to start using it to create your own web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you don't need to have any knowledge of Django. Ideally, you would need to understand what server-side web programming and web frameworks are by reading the topics in our [Server-side website programming first steps](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/JavaScript/Server-Side_Website_Programming/Server-Side_First_Steps#server-side-website-programming-first-steps) module.

A general knowledge of programming concepts and [Python](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Python) is recommended, but is not essential to understanding the core concepts.

**Note**: Python is one of the easiest programming languages for novices to read and understand. That said, if you want to understand this module better, there are numerous free books and tutorials available on the Internet to help you out. (New programmers might want to check out the [Python for Non Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) page on the python.org wiki.)

**Personal note**: If you have followed me along in **My_Learning_Port** or you've been through a coding bootcamp, or have had some coding instruction, then you might want to follow this link to python.org's [Beginners Guide for Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers).

## Guides

**[Django introduction]()**

In this first Django article, we answer the question "What is Django?" and give you an overview of what makes this web framework special. We'll outline the main features, including some advanced functionality that we won't have time to cover in detail in this module. We'll also show you some of the main building blocks of a Django application, to give you an idea of what it can do before you set it up and start playing.

**[Setting up a Django development environment]()**

Now that you know what Django is for, we'll show you how to set up and test a Django development environment on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and macOS -- whatever common operating system you are using, this article should give you what you need to be able to start developing Django apps.

**[Django Tutorial: The Local Library website]()**

The first article in our practical tutorial series explains what you'll learn, and provides an overview of the "local library" -- an example website we'll be working through and evolving in subsequent articles.

**[Django Tutorial Part 2: Creating a skeleton website]()**

This article shows how you can create a "skeleton" website project, which you can then go on to populate with site-specific settings, urls, models, views, and templates.

**[Django Tutorial Part 3: Using models]()**

This article shows how to define models for the *LocalLibrary* website. Models represent the data structures we want to store our app's data in, and also allow Django to store data in a database for us (and modify it later on). It explains what a model is, how it is declared, and some of the main field types. It also briefly shows a few of the main ways you can access model data.

**[Django Tutorial Part 4: Django admin site]()**

Now that we've created models for the *LocalLibrary* website, we'll use the Django Admin site to add some "real" book data. First, we'll show you how to register the models with the admin site, then we'll show how to login and create some data. At the end, we show some ways in which you can further improve the presentation of the admin site.

**[Django Tutorial Part 5: Creating our home page]()**

We're now ready to ad the code to display our first full page: a home page for the *LocalLibrary* that shows how many records we have of each model type, and provides sidebar navigation links to our other pages. Along the way, we'll gain practical experience in writing basic URL maps and views, getting records from the database, and using templates.
