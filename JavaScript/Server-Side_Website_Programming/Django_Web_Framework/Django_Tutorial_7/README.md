# Django Tutorial Part 7: Sessions framework

This tutorial extends our [LocalLibrary](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/JavaScript/Server-Side_Website_Programming/Django_Web_Framework/Django_Tutorial_Local_Library#django-tutorial-the-local-library-website) website, adding a session-based visit-counter to the home page. This is a relatively simple example, but it does show how you can use the session framework to provide persistent behavior for anonymous users in your own sites.
