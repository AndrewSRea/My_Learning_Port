# Django Tutorial Part 10: Testing a Django web application

As websites grow, they become harder to test manually. Not only is there more to test but, as interactions between components become more complex, a small change in one area can impact other areas, so more changes will be required to ensure everything keeps working and errors are not introduced as more changes are made. One way to mitigate these problems is to write automated tests, which can easily and reliably be run every time you make a change. This tutorial shows how to automate *unit testing* of your website using Django's test framework.
