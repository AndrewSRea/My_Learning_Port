# Django Tutorial Part 9: Working with forms

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to work with HTML Forms in Django, and, in particular, the easiest way to write forms to create, update, and delete model instances. As part of this demonstration, we'll extend the [LocalLibrary]() website so that librarians can renew books, and create, update, and delete authors using our own forms (rather than using the admin application).
