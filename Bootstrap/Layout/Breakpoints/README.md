# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.

## Core concepts

* **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.** Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.

* **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.** Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. Bootstrap most commonly uses `min-width` in its media queries.

* **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** Bootstrap's CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.

## Available breakpoints

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as *grid tiers*, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you're using Bootstrap's source [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) files.

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X-Small | *None* | &lt; 576px |
| Small | `sm` | &ge; 576px |
| Medium | `md` | &ge; 768px |
| Large | `lg` | &ge; 992px |
| Extra large | `xl` | &ge; 1200px |
| Extra extra large | `xxl` | &ge; 1400px |

Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions--they don't specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.

These breakpoints are customizable via [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) -- you'll find them in a Sass map in Bootstrap's `_variables.scss` stylesheet. (Perhaps I will have to create a Sass folder within this Bootstrap folder.)
```
$grid-breakpoints: (
    xs: 0,
    sm: 576px,
    md: 768px,
    lg: 992px,
    xl: 1200px,
    xxl: 1400px
);
```

## Media Queries

Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, it uses a handful of [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to create sensible breakpoints for its layouts and interfaces. These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.

### Min-width

Bootstrap primarly uses the following media query ranges -- or breakpoints -- in its source Sass files for its layout, grid system, and components.
```
// Source mixins

// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (min-width: 0) { ... }`

@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xxl) { ... }

// Usage

// Example: Hide starting at `min-width: 0`, and then show at the `sm` breakpoint

.custom-class {
    display: none;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
    .custom-class {
        display: block;
    }
}
```
These Sass mixins translate in Bootstrap's compiled CSS using the values declared in its Sass variables. For example:
```
// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
// No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops, 1400px and up)
@media (min-width: 1400px) { ... }
```

### Max-width

Bootstrap occasionally uses media queries that go in the other direction (the given screen size *or smaller*):
```
// No media query necessary for xs breakpoint as it's effectively `@media (max-width: 0) { ... }`

@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-down(xxl) { ... }

// Example: Style from medium breakpoint and down

@include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
    .custom-class {
        display: block;
    }
}
```
These mixins take those declared breakpoints, subtract `.02px` from them, and use them as Bootstrap's `max-width` values. For example:
```
// X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
@media (max-width: 575.98px) { ... }

// Small devices (landscape phones, less than 768px)
@media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, less than 992px)
@media (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, less than 1200px)
@media (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }

// X-Large devices (large desktops, less than 1400px)
@media (max-width: 1399.98px) { ... }

// XX-Large devices (larger desktops)
// No media query since the xxl breakpoint has no upper bound on its width
```

**Why subtract .02px?** Browsers don't currently support [range context queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#range-context), so Bootstrap works around the limitations of [`min-` and `max-` prefixes](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mq-min-max) and viewports with fractional widths (which can occur under certain conditions on high-dpi [*dots per inch*] devices, for instance) by using values with higher precision.

### Single breakpoint

There are also media queries and mixins for targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths.
```
@include media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-only(xxl) { ... }
```

For example, the `@include media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }` will result in:
```
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991.98px) { ... }
```

### Between breakpoints

Similarly, media queries may span multiple breakpoint widths:
```
@include media-breakpoint-between(md, xl) { ... }
```
Which results in:
```
// Example
// Apply styles starting from medium devices and up to extra large devices
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) { ... }
```

## A code example using Bootstrap breakpoints

I am going to create an HTML document named [breakpoints-example.html](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/blob/main/Bootstrap/Layout/Breakpoints/breakpoints-example.html) which incorporates Bootstrap's breakpoint components into three rows of columns. When `breakpoints-example.html` is opened in a browser, if the browser window's width is shifted to a smaller or larger width, the columns will also change in width, and will also stack on top of each other in a smaller browser window, or sit side-by-side each other in a larger browser window.

See it running live [here](https://andrewsrea.github.io/My_Learning_Port/Bootstrap/Layout/Breakpoints/breakpoints-example.html).
