                                wears the crown. So open up your heart and just let it begin. Boy all this time was worth the waiting.

                                worthy. This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last night's dress. You think you've seen her 
                                in a magazine. I should've told you what you meant to me 'Cause now I pay the price. Takes you miles
