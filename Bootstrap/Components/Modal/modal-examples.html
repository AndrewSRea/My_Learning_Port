                                time for you to show it off. Can't replace you with a million rings. You open my eyes and I'm ready 
                                to go, lead me into the light. And here you are. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Come on, let your colors 
                                burst. So cover your eyes, I have a surprise. As I march alone to a different beat. Glitter all over

                                We'd keep all our promises be us against the world. In another life I would be your girl. We can dance, 
                                until we die, you and I, will be young forever. And on my 18th Birthday we got matching tattoos. So open 
                                up your heart and just let it begin. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. She eats your heart out. Like 
                                Jeffrey Dahmer (woo). Pop your confetti. (This is how we do) I know one spark will shock the world, yeah 
                                yeah. If you only knew what the future holds.

                                Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy. It’s in the palm of your hand now baby. So we hit 
                                the boulevard. So make a wish, I'll make it like your birthday everyday. Do you ever feel already buried 
                                deep six feet under? It's time to bring out the big balloons. You could've been the greatest. Passport 
                                stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic.

                                We're living the life. We're doing it right. Open up your heart. I was tryna hit it and quit it. Her 
                                love is like a drug. Always leaves a trail of stardust. The girl's a freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna 
                                Beach. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. All my girls vintage Chanel baby.

                                Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares. 
                                This is no big deal. Calling out my name. I could have rewrite your addiction. She's got that, je ne 
                                sais quoi, you know it. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. 'Cause, baby, you're a firework. Like 
                                thunder gonna shake the ground.
                            </p>

                                Just own the night like the 4th of July! I’m gon’ put her in a coma. What you're waiting for, it's 
                                time for you to show it off. Can't replace you with a million rings. You open my eyes and I'm ready 
                                to go, lead me into the light. And here you are. I’m gon’ put her in a coma. Come on, let your colors 
                                burst. So cover your eyes, I have a surprise. As I march alone to a different beat. Glitter all over 
                                the room pink flamingos in the pool.
