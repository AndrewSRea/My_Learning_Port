                            singing the Blues. Watch you circle the drain. Why don't you let me stop by? Heavy is the head that wears 
                            the crown. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up above. Wanna see the show in 3D, a movie. 
                            Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin. It’s a yes or no, no maybe.

                            high, so high, 'cause she’s got that one international smile. There's a stranger in my bed, there's a pounding 
                            in my head. Oh, no. In another life I would make you stay. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything. Suiting up for 
                            my crowning battle. Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Tone, tan fit and ready, turn 
                            it up cause its gettin' heavy. Her love is like a drug. I guess that I forgot I had a choice.

                            finest architecture. Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. Never 
                            planned that one day I'd be losing you. She eats your heart out. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic. 
                            I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one. Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Just own the night 
                            like the 4th of July! But you'd rather get wasted.

                            like a drug. All my girls vintage Chanel baby. Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets. 'Cause she's the 
                            muse and the artist. (This is how we do) So you wanna play with magic. So just be sure before you give it 
                            all to me. I'm walking, I'm walking on air (tonight). Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk. 
                            Catch her if you can. Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes.
