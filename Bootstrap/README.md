# Bootstrap

## Build fast, responsive sites with Bootstrap

Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap, the world's most popular front-end open source
toolkit (by Bootstrap's own reckoning), featuring [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) variables and mixins, responsive grid
system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.

## Installation of Bootstrap

There are two ways to install Bootstrap into your HTML document:

* Install Bootstrap's source Sass and JavaScript files via npm, Composer, or Meteor.

I was taught how to use npm packages through the Terminal window on my Visual Studio Code editor but again, we only covered
that technology over the course of a week so I vaguely remember how to use npm packages. But I will be covering that technology
in a future folder in My_Learning_Port folder. So therefore, I will not be using this technology just yet as I work with 
Bootstrap.

* [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) - When you only need to include Bootstrap's compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr.

I am familiar with this technology, as it is pretty the same as adding a CSS stylesheet link and a JavaScript ```<script>```
link into the ```<head>``` of an HTML document. In fact, I will be incorporating a [starter template](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/blob/main/Bootstrap/starter-template.html) provided by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) throughout all of the files inside this Bootstrap folder. 
This starter template provides the necessary Bootstrap CSS and the Bootstrap JavaScript and Popper.js needed to be able to incorporate
all the Bootstrap components into an HTML document.

## Side note

As [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) was mentioned above, if Sass is a necessary component of Bootstrap, I may have to create a separate folder containing instructions and code examples for Sass. I will add this folder after this Bootstrap folder if I deem it necessary.
