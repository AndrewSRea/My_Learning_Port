# Shadows

Add or remove shadows to elements with box-shadow utilities.

## Examples

While shadows on components are disabled by default in Bootstrap and can be enabled via `$enable-shadows`, you can also quickly add or remove a shadow with our `box-shadow` utility classes. Includes support for `.shadow-none` and three default sizes (which have associated variables to match).
