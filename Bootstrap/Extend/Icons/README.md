# Icons

Guidance and suggestions for using external icon libraries with Bootstrap.

While Bootstrap doesn't include an icon set by default, it does have its own comprehensive icon library called Bootstrap Icons. Feel free to use them or any other icon set in your project. Details for Bootstrap Icons and other preferred icon sets are included below.

While most icon sets include multiple file formats, Bootstrap prefers SVG implementation for their immproved accessibility and vector support.

## Bootstrap Icons

Bootstrap Icons is a growing library of SVG icons that are designed by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) and maintained by [the Bootstrap Team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people). The beginnings of this icon set come from Bootstrap's very own components--its forms, carousels, and more. Bootstrap has very few icon needs out of the box, so it didn't need much. However, once Bootstrap got going, the devs couldn't stop making more.

Oh, and by the way, Bootstrap Icons are completely open source! Licensed under MIT, just like Bootstrap, its icon set is available to everyone.
