# Download

Download Bootstrap to get the compiled CSS and JavaScript, source code, or include it with your favorite package managers like npm, RubyGems, and more.

## Compiled CSS and JS

Download ready-to-use compiled code for **Bootstrap v5.0.0-beta3** to easily drop into your project, which includes:

* Compiled and minified CSS bundles (see [CSS files comparison]()) <!-- link to next page, Contents (header: 'CSS files') -->
* Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins (see [JS files compaarison]()) <!-- link to next page, Contents (header: 'JS files') -->

This doesn't include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies like Popper.

**[Download](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.0.0-beta3/bootstrap-5.0.0-bta3-dis.zip)**

## Source files

Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading Bootstrap's source Sass, JavaScript, and documenation files. This option requires some additional tooling:

* [Sass compiler]() for compiling Sass source files into CSS files <!-- link to 'Build tools' page, header 'Sass' -->
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for CSS vendor prefixing

Should you require Bootstrap's full set of [build tools](), they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they're likely unstable for your own purposes. <!-- link to 'Build tools' page, header 'Tooling setup' -->
