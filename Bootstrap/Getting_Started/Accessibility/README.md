# Accessibility

A brief overview of Bootstrap's features and limitations for the creation of accessible content.

Bootstrap provides an easy-to-use framework of ready-made styles, layout tools, and interactive components, allowing developers to create websites and applications that are visually appealing, functionally rich, and accessible out of the box.

## Overview and limitations

The overall accessibility of any project built with Bootstrap depends in large part on the author's markup, additional styling, and scripting they've included. However, provided that these have been implemented correctly, it should be perfectly possible to create websites and applications with Bootstrap that fulfill [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (A/AA/AAA), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), and similar accessibility standards and requirements.

### Structural markup

Bootstrap's styling and layout an be applied to a wide range of markup structures. This documentation aims to provide developers with best practice examples to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap itself and illustrate appropriate semantic markup, including ways in which potential accessiblity concerns can be addressed.

### Interactive components

Bootstrap's interactive components--such as modal dialogs, dropdown menus, and custom tooltips--are designed to work for touch, mouse, and keyboard users. Through the use of relevant [WAI-ARIA]() roles and attributes, these components should also be understandable and operable using assistive technologies (such as screen readers).
