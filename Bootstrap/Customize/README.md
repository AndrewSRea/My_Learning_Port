## Overview

There are multiple ways to customize Bootstrap. Your best path can depend on your project, the complexity of your build tools, the version of Bootstrap you're using, browser support, and more.

Bootstrap's two preferred methods are:

1. Using Bootstrap [via package manager](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Getting_Started/Download#package-managers) so you can use and extend its source files.
2. Using Bootstrap's compiled distribution files or [jsDelivr](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Getting_Started/Download#cdn-via-jsdelivr) so you can add onto or override Bootstrap's styles.

While the Bootstrap devs cannot go into details here on how to use every package manager, they can give some guidance on [using Bootstrap with your own Sass compiler](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Customize/Sass#sass).

For those who want to use the distribution files, review the [getting started page](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Getting_Started/Introduction#introduction) for how to utilize Boostrap's global options, making use of and changing its color system, how to build its components, how to use its growing list of CSS custom properties, and how to optimize your code when building with Bootstrap.

## CSPs and embedded SVGs

Several Bootstrap components include embedded SVGs in Bootstrap's CSS to style components consistently and easily across browsers and devices. **For organizations with more strict [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) configurations**, Bootstrap has documented all instances of its embedded SVGs (all of which are applied via `background-image`) so you can more thoroughly review your options.

* [Accordion](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Components/Accordion#accordion)
* [Close button](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Components/Close_Button#close-button) (used in alerts and modals)
* [Form checkboxes and radio buttons](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Forms/Checks_and_Radios#checks-and-radios)
* [Form switches](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Forms/Checks_and_Radios#switches)
* [Form validation icons](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Forms/Validation#server-side)
* [Select menus](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Forms/Select#select)
* [Carousel controls](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Components/Carousel#carousel)
* [Navbar toggle buttons](https://github.com/AndrewSRea/My_Learning_Port/tree/main/Bootstrap/Components/Navbar#responsive-behaviors)

Based on [community conversation](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25394), some options for addressing this in your own codebase include replacing the URLs with locally hosted assets, removing the images and using inline images (not possible in all components), and modifying your CSP. Bootstrap's recommendation is to carefully review your own security policies and decide on a best path forward, if necessary.
